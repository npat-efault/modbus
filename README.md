# modbus

Package modbus implements the MobBus protocol.

This package provides low-level functions and types for implementing
ModBus protocol servers (slaves) and clients (masters). Modbus over
asynchronous serial lines is supported (RTU and ASCII frame encodings)
as well as ModBus over TCP. Additionally, complete implementations of
simple modbus clients and servers are included.
